my learning journey towards building a Spotify AI agent with LangGraph

# Spotify Agent

Sadly, due to changes to the Spotify Web API, it is now impossible to implement my original idea for this project. The initial plan was to build an AI agent that would fulfil natural language requests of the form "Find 10 songs similar to song XY by ZY and put them into a playlist called ABC". Since the Recommendations and Audio Features endpoints are deprecated as of November 2024, we can't easily search the Spotify DB for songs with similar features anymore.

The new project plan is to make it at least possible to ask the agent to put a number of specific or random songs by a specific artist into a playlist with a specified name.
